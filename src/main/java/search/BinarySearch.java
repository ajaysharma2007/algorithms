    - max need to be equal to array length - 1
    - And exit condition needs to be: min <= max.
    - Only if both of the above conditions are true only then all indexes in as array will be covered.

/*
    - If we take following condition:
        - max = array length and
        - exit condition => min < max
            - Here we can't have min = max because then if both min and max becomes equal to array length then it will be
            ArrayIndexOutOfBound exception.
        - In this scenario if we take array as [1,2,3,4,5] then only following indexes will be covered:
            - 2, 4, 0

/*
    The logarithm function grows very slowly. Logarithms are the inverse of exponentials, which grow very rapidly, so that if lg n=x, then n = 2^xâ€‹ .
    For example, because lg 128 = 7, we know that 2^7 = 128.

    When n(number of elements in an array) is not a power of 2, we can just go up to the next higher power of 2.
    For an array whose length is 1000, the next higher power of 2 is 1024, which equals 2^10.
    Therefore, for a 1000-element array, binary search would require at most 11 (10 + 1) guesses.
